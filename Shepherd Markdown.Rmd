#imported API_SI.POV.GINI_DS2_en_csv_v2_31732 from web
#cleaned up data manually, renamed "Gini_Inequality_Index"

#imported WITS-Country-Timeseries.csv
#cleaned up data manually, renamed "GDP_clean.csv

#moving forward, both must be tidied

#tidied Gini_Inequality_Index_clean (gathered, renamed), created "Gini_Inequality_Index_tidy.csv"
#tidied GDP_clean (gathered, renamed), created "GDP_tidy.csv"

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
